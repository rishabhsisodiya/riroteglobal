1.  React 18 introduces a new root API which provides better ergonomics for managing roots. The new root API also enables the new concurrent renderer, which allows you to opt-into concurrent features.

### // Before

```jsx
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const container = document.getElementById('app');

render(<App tab="home" />, container);
```
### // After

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('app');

const root = createRoot(container); // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript

root.render(<App tab="home" />);
```

1.  Also, unmountComponentAtNode to root.unmount changed:

// Before

```jsx
unmountComponentAtNode(container);
```
// After

```jsx
root.unmount();
```

1.  Callback from render also removed, since it usually does not have the expected result when using Suspense:

// Before

```jsx
const container = document.getElementById('app');

render(<App tab="home" />, container, () => {

console.log('rendered');

});
```
// After

```jsx
function AppWithCallbackAfterRender() {

useEffect(() => {

console.log('rendered');

});

return <App tab="home" />

}

const container = document.getElementById('app');

const root = createRoot(container);

root.render(<AppWithCallbackAfterRender />);
```

1.  Finally, if your app uses server-side rendering with hydration, upgrade hydrate to hydrateRoot:

// Before

```jsx
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom';

const container = document.getElementById('app');

hydrate(<App tab="home" />, container);
```
// After

```jsx
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('app');

const root = hydrateRoot(container, <App tab="home" />);
```
// Unlike with createRoot, you don't need a separate root.render() call here.

1.  If your project uses TypeScript, you will need to update your @types/react and @types/react-dom dependencies to the latest versions.

### Automatic Batching

React 18 adds out-of-the-box performance improvements by doing more batching by default. Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Before React 18, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function App(props) {

const \[state, setState\] = useState(0);

console.log('render', state);

useEffect(() => {

(async () => {

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

await new Promise((res) => {

setTimeout(res, 500);
```
})

```jsx
console.log('before set state');

setState(val => val + 1);

console.log('after set state');

}

})();

}, \[\]);

return (
```
<h1>{state}</h1>

```jsx
);

}
```

**Console output:**

### React 17

render 0

before set state

render 1

after set state

before set state

render 2

after set state

before set state

render 3

after set state

### React 18

render 0

before set state

after set state

render 1

before set state

after set state

render 2

before set state

after set state

render 3

React 18 made changes to setState so that multiple can be batched into a single render. React 17 had batching too, but it could only work for synchronous code that happened in a react lifecycle event (eg, useEffect), or a dom event (eg, onClick). React 18 expanded that functionality, so now it works in your async function.

If you want to force a render to happen synchronously you can, but this is very rarely needed and i do not recommend it:

```jsx
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';
```
// ...

```jsx
console.log('before set state');

flushSync(() => {

setState(val => val + 1);
```
})

```jsx
console.log('after set state');
```

### Transitions

Transitions can be used to mark UI updates that do not need urgent resources for updating.

For example, when typing in a typeahead field, there are two things happening: a blinking cursor that shows visual feedback of your content being typed, and a search functionality in the background that searches for the data that is typed.

Showing visual feedback to the user is important and therefore urgent. Searching is not so urgent, and so can be marked as non-urgent.

These non-urgent updates are called transitions. By marking non-urgent UI updates as "transitions", React will know which updates to prioritize. This makes it easier to optimize rendering and get rid of stale rendering.

**You can mark updates as non-urgent by using startTransition.** Here is an example of what a typeahead component would like when marked with transitions:

```jsx
import { startTransition } from 'react';
```
// Urgent: Show what was typed

```jsx
setInputValue(input);
```
// Mark any non-urgent state updates inside as transitions

```jsx
startTransition(() => {
```
// Transition: Show the results

```jsx
setSearchQuery(input);

});
```

**How are transitions different from debouncing or setTimeout?**

startTransition executes immediately, unlike setTimeout.setTimeout has a guaranteed delay, whereas startTransition's delay depends on the speed of the device, and other urgent renders. startTransition updates can be interrupted unlike setTimeout and won't freeze the page. React can track the pending state for you when marked with startTransition.

### Suspense on the server

React 18 introduces:

-   Code splitting on the server with suspense
-   Streaming rendering on the server

### Client rendering vs server rendering

In a client-rendered app, you load the HTML of your page from the server along with all the JavaScript that is needed to run the page, and make it interactive.

If, however, your JavaScript bundle is huge, or you have a slow connection, this process can take a long time and the user will be waiting for the page to become interactive, or to see meaningful content.

For optimizing the user experience and avoiding the user having to sit on a blank screen, we can use server rendering.

Server rendering is a technique where you render the HTML output of your React components on the server and send HTML from the server. This lets the user view some UI while JS bundles are loading and before the app becomes interactive.

### Updates to Server Rendering APIs

In this release, we’re revamping our react-dom/server APIs to fully support Suspense on the server and Streaming SSR. As part of these changes, we’re deprecating the old Node streaming API, which does not support incremental Suspense streaming on the server.

Using this API will now warn:

-   renderToNodeStream: Deprecated ⛔️️ Instead, for streaming in Node environments, use:

### renderToPipeableStream: New ✨

-   We’re also introducing a new API to support streaming SSR with Suspense for modern edge runtime environments, such as Deno and Cloudflare workers:

### renderToReadableStream: New ✨

-   The following APIs will continue working, but with limited support for Suspense:
-   **renderToString**: Limited ⚠️ and **renderToStaticMarkup**: Limited ⚠️
-   Finally, this API will continue to work for rendering e-mails: **renderToStaticNodeStream**
