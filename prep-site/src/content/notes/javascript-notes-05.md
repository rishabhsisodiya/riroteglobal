### What is a closure?

Let's take an example:

```js
function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  y();
}

x();
```

**Output:** `7`

In DevTools you can see that the function `y()` has `[[Scopes]]`, which contains `a`. So even when we return `y()` and use it later, it will still have `a` with the value 7.

A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. **So a function along with its lexical scope bundled together forms a closure.**

```js
function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  a = 100;
  return y;
}

var z = x();
console.log(z);
z();
```

**Output:**

```
ƒ y() {
  console.log(a);
}
100
```

**Note:** Here the closure comes into the picture. A returned function always maintains its lexical scope — the function along with a **reference** to those variables (e.g. `var a`). It remembers where it was actually present. So in simple terms, the code does not just return a function; it returns a **closure** (the function along with its lexical scope).

It prints `100`, not `7`, because the closure keeps a **reference** to the variable `a`, not a copy of its value at the time `y` was created.

### Scope chain

```js
function z() {
  var b = 900;
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a, b);
    }
    y();
  }
  x();
}

z();
```

**Output:** `7 900`

![](/notes-img/javascript-notes/img-015.webp)

So now `y` forms a closure with the scope of `x` **and** `z`.

**Uses of closures:**

-   Module design pattern
-   Currying
-   Functions like `once` (run only once)
-   Memoize
-   Maintaining state in the async world
-   `setTimeout`
-   Iterators, and many more

### setTimeout and closure

```js
function x() {
  var a = 1;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(a);
  }, 3000);
  console.log("Hello JavaScript");
}

x();
```

**Output:**

```
Hello JavaScript
1        (after 3 seconds)
```

`setTimeout` takes the callback function, attaches it to a timer, and when the timer expires it calls that function. JavaScript doesn't wait for the timer. The callback forms a closure, so it still remembers `a` even though `x()` finished long ago.

**Let's print 1 to 5, where each number `n` is printed after `n` seconds (n = 1…5).**

Normally we try the example below, but it prints a different output:

```js
function x() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
  console.log("Hello JavaScript");
}

x();
```

**Output:**

```
Hello JavaScript
6
6
6
6
6
```

The loop does not wait for the timers. All five callbacks form a closure with the **same** `var i` (a reference, not a copy). By the time the timers expire, the loop has already finished and `i` has become 6.

#### Case 1: fix it with let (block scope)

```js
function x() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
  console.log("Hello JavaScript");
}

x();
```

**Output:**

```
Hello JavaScript
1
2
3
4
5
```

Because `let` is block-scoped, every time the loop runs, `i` is a new copy altogether. The function in `setTimeout` forms a closure with a new copy of `i` bound to it.

#### Case 2: fix it with a closure, using only var

```js
function x() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    function closer(i) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
      }, i * 1000);
    }
    closer(i);
  }
  console.log("Hello JavaScript");
}

x();
```

**Output:**

```
Hello JavaScript
1
2
3
4
5
```

Every time you call `closer(i)`, it creates a new function scope with its own copy of `i` (the parameter), and the callback closes over that copy.

The same fix is often written with an **IIFE**:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), j * 1000);
  })(i);
}
```

### Some more examples

Consider this as the base code:

```js
function outer() {
  var a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}

outer()();
```

**Output:** `10`

`outer()()` means: call `outer()`, which returns `inner`, then immediately call that returned function.

#### Case 1: use let instead of var, declared just before the return statement

```js
function outer() {
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  let a = 10;
  return inner;
}

outer()();
```

**Output:** `10`

The position of `a` doesn't matter, because `inner` runs **after** `let a = 10` has executed.

**Subcase: call the inner function before `a` is initialized**

```js
function outer() {
  inner();
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
}

outer();
```

**Output:**

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
```

Here we are trying to access **`let a` before initialization**. Since it is `let`, it is in the **temporal dead zone**, so we cannot use it before initialization. If we used `var` instead of `let`, it would run successfully but print `undefined`. To understand more, compare it with the example from Variable Hoisting:

```js
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

var a = 10;
let b = 10;
```

**Output:**

```
undefined
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
```

#### Case 2: pass a parameter from the outer scope

```js
function outer(b) {
  function inner() {
    console.log(a, b);
  }
  let a = 10;
  return inner;
}

var close = outer("Hello");
close();
```

**Output:** `10 "Hello"`

The inner function forms a closure with its outer function's environment, and the parameter `b` is part of the outer function's environment, so `inner` can access it.

#### Case 3: the outer function is inside another function

```js
function outermost() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(b) {
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, b, c);
    }
    let a = 10;
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}

var close = outermost()("Hello");
close();
```

**Output:** `10 "Hello" 20`

Now the inner function forms a closure with both `outer` and `outermost`, and has access to both environments.

#### Case 4: a variable with a conflicting name is defined outside

```js
function outermost() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(b) {
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, b, c);
    }
    let a = 10;
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}

let a = 100;
var close = outermost()("Hello");
close();
```

**Output:** `10 "Hello" 20`

Since `inner` forms a closure with `outer` and `outermost`, it finds `a` in its nearest parent scope (`outer`) first. **So defining a global variable with the same name does not have any impact on the closure.**

#### Case 5: `let a = 10` is not present in outer()

```js
function outermost() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(b) {
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, b, c);
    }
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}

let a = 100;
var close = outermost()("Hello");
close();
```

**Output:** `100 "Hello" 20`

When a function doesn't find `a` in its own lexical environment, it searches its parent, then the parent's parent, all the way up to the global scope. Here it finds `a = 100` in the global scope. If `a` is not present in the global scope either, it throws **ReferenceError: a is not defined**.

### Closures for data hiding and encapsulation

```js
var counter = 0;

function incrementCounter() {
  counter++;
}
```

In this case, anyone (any other function) can access the variable `counter` and change it.

So a good way to implement data hiding is:

```js
function counter() {
  var count = 0;
  return function incrementCounter() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

var counter1 = counter();
counter1();
counter1();
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
```

Now we can increment the counter, but we can't change `count` in any other way — there is no direct access to it.

```js
console.log(counter1.count); // undefined
// console.log(count);       // ReferenceError: count is not defined
```

**Case: what if we store the closure in 2 different variables and call them?**

```js
function counter() {
  var count = 0;
  return function incrementCounter() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

var counter1 = counter();
counter1();
counter1();

var counter2 = counter();
counter2();
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
1
```

Each call to `counter()` creates a **new** `count`, so `counter2` has its own separate copy.

#### Scalability

The above code is not **scalable**. To make it scalable, we can add other functions like decrement. One way is a constructor function:

```js
function Counter() {
  var count = 0;

  this.incrementCounter = function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };

  this.decrementCounter = function () {
    count--;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

var counter1 = new Counter();
counter1.incrementCounter(); // 1
counter1.incrementCounter(); // 2
counter1.decrementCounter(); // 1
console.log(counter1.count); // undefined — still private
```

Above is a constructor function, and `counter1` gives access to both **methods**, which share the same private `count`.

The same thing with a plain function returning an object (module pattern):

```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    get value() { return count; }
  };
}

const c = createCounter();
c.increment();
c.increment();
c.decrement();
console.log(c.value); // 1
```

### Practical uses of closures

#### once — run a function only once

```js
function once(fn) {
  let called = false;
  let result;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      result = fn.apply(this, args);
    }
    return result;
  };
}

const init = once(() => {
  console.log('Initialized');
  return 42;
});

console.log(init()); // "Initialized", then 42
console.log(init()); // 42 — the function body does not run again
```

#### memoize — cache results

```js
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return function (n) {
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('from cache');
      return cache[n];
    }
    return (cache[n] = fn(n));
  };
}

const square = memoize(n => n * n);
console.log(square(4)); // 16
console.log(square(4)); // "from cache", then 16
```

#### Function factory

```js
function multiplyBy(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x * y;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);
console.log(double(5), triple(5)); // 10 15
```

#### Module pattern (IIFE)

```js
const bank = (function () {
  let balance = 0;                  // private
  function log(msg) { console.log(msg); } // private helper

  return {
    deposit(amount) {
      balance += amount;
      log(`Deposited ${amount}`);
    },
    getBalance() {
      return balance;
    }
  };
})();

bank.deposit(500);             // "Deposited 500"
console.log(bank.getBalance()); // 500
console.log(bank.balance);      // undefined
```

### Disadvantages

-   **Over-consumption of memory**, because every time a closure forms, its variables are kept in memory.
-   **Closed-over variables are not garbage collected** as long as the closure (the inner function) is still reachable.
-   **If not handled properly, it can lead to memory leaks** (e.g. event listeners or timers holding closures that are never removed).

**Garbage collection** (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.

### Relation between garbage collection and closures

```js
function a() {
  var x = 0, z = 10;
  return function b() {
    console.log(x);
  };
}

var y = a();
// .....
y();
```

`b()` forms a closure with `a()`. Normally `x` could be garbage collected after `a()` finishes, but due to the closure it is not freed. So the memory for `x` cannot be freed **as long as `y` is reachable**.

But modern browsers (e.g. V8 in Chrome) have smart garbage collection: since `z` is **not used** by `b`, its memory can be freed.

To release the closure, remove the reference:

```js
y = null; // now b and x can be garbage collected
```

**Memory leak example**

```js
function attach() {
  const bigData = new Array(1_000_000).fill('*');
  document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function handler() {
    console.log(bigData.length); // closure keeps bigData alive
  });
}
// Fix: remove the listener when it is no longer needed
// button.removeEventListener('click', handler);
```

### Closure interview questions

```js
// Q1: What is the output?
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return () => ++count;
}
const a1 = makeCounter();
const b1 = makeCounter();
console.log(a1(), a1(), b1()); // 1 2 1 — separate closures
```

```js
// Q2: What is the output?
var fns = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  fns.push(() => i);
}
console.log(fns.map(f => f())); // [3, 3, 3] — all share one i (use let to get [0, 1, 2])
```

```js
// Q3: What is the output?
let x = 1;
const getX = () => x;
x = 2;
console.log(getX()); // 2 — closures read the current value, not a snapshot
```

```js
// Q4: Implement a function that adds, sum(1)(2)(3)() → 6
function sum(a) {
  return function (b) {
    if (b === undefined) return a;
    return sum(a + b);
  };
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)()); // 6
```
